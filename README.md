# üè†üñ•Ô∏è home-server

## üëÅÔ∏è Project Overview

This repository contains the configuration for a personal home server, designed to run essential home services using Docker containers. The goal is to create a centralized, modular, and easily reproducible environment for managing network services, home automation, and data storage.

By using a single `docker-compose.yml` file, all services and their dependencies are defined in one place, simplifying setup and ensuring consistent deployment. This approach allows for easy scalability by adding or removing services as needed.

## üîë Key Services

The project currently includes configurations for the following services:

* **[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/):** A robust relational database for data storage. It's used by Home Assistant and can be used by any other service or customized application you build.
* **[nginx](https://nginx.org/):** A high-performance web server, reverse proxy, and load balancer. The main role of nginx is to provide forwarding from any web interface the services may have to a subdomain, ensuring all services use HTTPS when accessed.
* **[Pi-Hole](https://pi-hole.net/):** A network-wide ad and tracker blocking DNS server.
* **[Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/):** A powerful open-source home automation platform for local control of smart devices.
* **[Komodo](https://komo.do/):** A tool to provide structure for managing your servers, builds, deployments, and automated procedures.
* **[Webmin](https://webmin.com/):** A system administration tool for Unix-like servers and services (optional).

üí° Webmin support is an optional component selected during installation. While the following documentation references Webmin, you may ignore all related sections if you did not install it.

**Future services:** The modular design allows for the easy addition of other services, such as media servers, file storage, and more.

## üåê Domain and Subdomains

The domain for all web services is defined during installation. This project automatically creates the chosen domain and corresponding subdomains for each service with a web interface.

Using the example domain `homeserver.lan`, the following subdomains would be generated:

- `pihole.homeserver.lan` for Pi-Hole
- `ha.homeserver.lan` for Home Assistant
- `komodo.homeserver.lan` for Komodo
- `webmin.homeserver.lan` for Webmin

The setup also generates a self-signed certificate for the domain and all subdomains. A `ca.crt` file is provided, which you can install on your devices to ensure browsers recognize the HTTPS certificates within your local network. All services are proxied through nginx.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* [**Docker**](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
* [**Docker Compose**](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (v2 or superior)

### Installation and Deployment

The installation is managed by an interactive script that sets up a clean production environment, separate from the Git repository.

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/danielcdias/home-server.git
    cd home-server
    ```

2.  **Create the Secrets File (`.env`):**
    Copy the example file `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in all the necessary passwords and secrets.

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    nano .env
    ```
    **This step is crucial.** The `.env` file will contain all your passwords.

3.  **Create PostgreSQL Initial User Configuration:**
    Create the `./postgres/config/config.json` file with the databases to be created when PostgreSQL starts. For example, the Home Assistant database:

    ```json
    [
        {
            "db_name": "home_assistant",
            "user": "homeassistant",
            "password": "a_strong_password"
        }
    ]
    ```
    ‚ö†Ô∏è **ATTENTION!** The database information here MUST BE THE SAME as defined in the `.env` file.

4.  **Run the Installation Script:**
    Execute the `install.sh` script with `sudo`. It will guide you through the configuration process.

    ```bash
    sudo ./install.sh
    ```
    The script will ask for:
    * **Installation Directory:** The location where the runtime files will be stored (default: `/opt/home-server`).
    * **Domain Name (Hostname)**: The base name for accessing your services (default: the machine's hostname).
        
        ‚ö†Ô∏è **Attention**: **It is highly recommended** that you use the default value, which is your machine's actual hostname. The local DNS (Pi-hole), part of this project, is automatically configured so that this name points to your server's correct IP address, ensuring everything works out of the box.
        
        If you choose a domain name different from the machine's hostname (e.g., `my-server`), the services will not be accessible over the network until you manually configure a "DNS Record" in the Pi-hole dashboard, pointing your custom domain to the server's IP address. The customization option is intended for advanced users who understand this need.

    * **Domain Suffix:** Your local network's suffix (default: `lan`).
    * **Webmin Support:** Whether you want to install and configure Webmin.

5.  **Start the Services:**
    After the script finishes, the `homeserver.service` systemd service will be created and enabled. You can start the services immediately with:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl start homeserver.service
    ```
    To check the status, use `sudo systemctl status homeserver.service`. The services will also start automatically with the system.

## üì° Available Services

After installation, the services will be available through a secure reverse proxy with HTTPS encryption at the following addresses (replace `homeserver.lan` with your chosen domain):

- **Central Dashboard**: `https://homeserver.lan/`
- **Pi-hole**: `https://pihole.homeserver.lan/admin/`
- **Home Assistant**: `https://ha.homeserver.lan/`
- **Komodo**: `https://komodo.homeserver.lan/`
- **Webmin**: `https://webmin.homeserver.lan/`

## ‚öôÔ∏è Additional Configuration Notes

### SSL Certificates

The self-signed certificates generated during installation need to be trusted on your devices:

1. Locate the `ca.crt` file in your installation directory (e.g., `/opt/home-server/nginx/ssl/ca.crt`).
2. Import it into your device's or browser's trusted root certificate authorities. This will prevent security warnings.

### Network Considerations

- Ensure your router is configured to use Pi-Hole as the DNS server for your network.
- The nginx reverse proxy uses port 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS).
- Make sure these ports are forwarded correctly if accessing from outside your network.

### Backup Recommendations

Regularly backup:

- PostgreSQL databases using `pg_dump`.
- Docker volumes containing application data (e.g., `mongo-data`, `postgres_data`).
- The installation directory, which contains your configuration files (`config.env`, `.env`, etc.).
